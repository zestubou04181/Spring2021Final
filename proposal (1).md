# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Underrated Johtodex

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An application that will allow you to see all the Pokemon data files in a given region.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a Pokedex that shows Pokemon data entries. It will have pictures, text, etc. Another feature I want my Pokedex to have is to be able to link to the website Pokemon Showdown so that viewers can play real-time Pokemon battles and put their newfound knowledge to good use. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is the base completion of a Pokedex AND a functioning link to the Pokemon Showdown website in a browser

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of my project would be a tricked out Pokedex, a functioning link to Pokemon Showdown, AND a quiz link that tests the knowledge you've learned.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of my project would be a fully fleshed out Pokedex with higher quality graphics and features, a functioning link to Pokemon Showdown, AND a quiz link that tests the knowledge you've learned.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to create a Pokedex so I will be learning from the cs50 module on our canvas page and then I will need to learn how to hyperlink sites in the language that I am using.
