Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have framed my pokedex and gathered up helpful materials and resources to complete it. I am using a file I found online to tackle the tedious part of recording every Pokemon's information so once I build the Pokedex's design, layout, and coding, I can input all that information for my complete project.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

My outside links to Pokemon Showdown and the framing for my pokedex.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am struggling with understanding the various procedures and languages needed to make this work the way I have formed in mind. The challenge is fun
