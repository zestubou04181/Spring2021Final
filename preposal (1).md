# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create a Pokedex with a unique twist to the project to separate it from the lab assignment. I'm thinking of using a generation other than the 1st one, it's so played out and overrated and I want to be able to have the user press a "random" button that will pull up a Pokedex entry for a random Pokemon. I also want to be able to link it to the website pokemonshowdown.com so viewers of this project can try their hand at online pokemon battling (it's one of my favorite time-wasting sites). And another idea I have is to create a quiz to test ones knowledge of the Pokemon listed.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not have partners at the moment, I foresee that I will be working solo.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How can I differentiate this program and make it viable and unique as a final project?
What sort of features should a standard Pokedex have?
